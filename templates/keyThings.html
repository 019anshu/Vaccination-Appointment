            <li>You may have side effects after vaccination, but these are normal.</li>
            <li>It typically takes two weeks after you are fully vaccinated for the body

            <li>Vaccines will become widely available, in the coming months. Find a COVID-19 vaccine.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>We are still learning how well vaccines prevent you from spreading
                the virus that causes COVID-19 to others, even if you do not have symptoms.</li>
            <li>Weâ€™re also still learning how long COVID-19 vaccines protect people.</li>
            <li>We are still learning how many people have to be vaccinated against COVID-19
                before most people can be considered protected (population immunity).</li>
            <li>We are still learning how effective the vaccines are against new variants of the
                virus that causes COVID-19.</li>
