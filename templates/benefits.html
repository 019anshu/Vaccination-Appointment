                <hr>
                <p>
                    We understand that some people may be concerned about getting vaccinated
                    now that COVID-19 vaccines are available in our country. While more
                    COVID-19 vaccines are being developed as quickly as possible, routine
                    processes and procedures remain in place to ensure the safety of any vaccine
                    that is authorized or approved for use. Safety is a top priority, and there
                    are many reasons to get vaccinated.

                <ul>
                    <li>All COVID-19 vaccines currently available in India have been shown
                        to be highly effective at preventing COVID-19. </li>
                    <li>All COVID-19 vaccines that are in development are being carefully
                        evaluated in clinical trials and will be authorized or approved only
                        if they make it substantially less likely you’ll get COVID-19. </li>
                    <li>Based on what we know about vaccines for other diseases and early data
                        from clinical trials, experts believe that getting a COVID-19 vaccine
                        may also help keep you from getting seriously ill even if you do get
                        COVID-19.</li>
                    <li>Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you,
                        particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.</li>
                    <li>Experts continue to conduct more studies about the effect of COVID-19
                        vaccination on severity of illness from COVID-19, as well as its ability
                        to keep people from spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>COVID-19 can have serious, life-threatening complications, and there
                        is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you. And if you get sick,
                        you could spread the disease to friends, family, and others around you.</li>
                    <li>Clinical trials of all vaccines must first show they are safe and
                        effective before any vaccine can be authorized or approved for use,
                        including COVID-19 vaccines. The known and potential benefits of a COVID-19
                        vaccine must outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine
                        for use under what is known as an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). </li>
                    <li>Getting COVID-19 may offer some natural protection, known as immunity.
                        Current evidence suggests that reinfection with the virus that causes
                        COVID-19 is uncommon in the 90 days after initial infection. However,
                        experts don’t know for sure how long this protection lasts, and the risk
                        of severe illness and death from COVID-19 far outweighs any benefits of
                        natural immunity. COVID-19 vaccination will help protect you by creating
                        an antibody (immune system) response without having to experience sickness.</li>
                    <li>Both natural immunity and immunity produced by a vaccine are important
                        parts of COVID-19 disease that experts are trying to learn more about,
                        and CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available.</li>
